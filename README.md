# Intelligent-System-Medical-Images
Attempts to absorb applications of ML in Medical Images domain 

## the first endevour, follwoing techniques have been impleneted:
    1. conversion of raw mammography data into a gray-scale image:
            Implement the three main steps necessary to convert raw data into a gray-level image:
              - Logaritmic transformation
              - Intensity inversion
              - Contrast stretching
              
    2. stain normalization in digital pathology with histogram matching
              - In pathology, tissue samples are cut and stained with specific dyes in order to enhance some tissues that are relevant for the diagnosis.
              - The most commonly used staining is called Hematoxylyn and Eosin (H&E), which is routinely applied for diagnostic purposes.
              
    3. trachea detection in chest CT with blob detection
